## Hi there 👋

I'm Victor, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Dynamic Macroecology Group](https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/organisation/forschungseinheiten/landschaftsdynamik/dynamische-makrooekologie/) at the [Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape (WSL)](https://www.wsl.ch/en/index.html) 🇨🇭.
<br>

🌱 I am broadly interested in understanding and predicting the **dynamics of natural systems** by **developing methods** leveraging the **extrapolation ability of mechanistic models** with the **flexibility of machine learning techniques**. My main domain of application is **ecology**, where I focus on understanding the dynamics of ecosystems and their response to disruptions. 

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

- 🦌`JAXScape`, a differentiable connectivity analysis library, developed within the framework of the [SPEED2ZERO](https://speed2zero.ethz.ch/en/) project. `JAXScape` is currently used to identify important sites to sustain ecological connectivity in Switzerland, see [here](https://github.com/vboussange/CH_connectivity_analysis) and an interactive visualisation within the [Swiss SolarWind Explorer](https://swiss-solarwind-explorer-v1.ethz.ch).
- 📈`PiecewiseInference.jl`, a library to fit autoregressive models and ODEs with gradient-based optimizers.

## 🕣 In the past, I have worked on 
- `HighDimPDE.jl`, a deep learning-based solver for highly dimensional, non-local, nonlinear PDEs which now belongs to the SciML ecosystem.
- 🕸️ Eco-evolutionary models, and in particular models structured over graphs, with e.g. `EvoID.jl` and ` EcoEvoModelZoo.jl`.
